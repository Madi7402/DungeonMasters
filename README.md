## Iteration 1
For this iteration, the team worked on setup up, review, and implementing the model class for our dungeon adventure project. Issues of note include time restrictions and communication. Going forward we plan on meeting every Tuesday and Thursday to touchbase and keep on track. Currently, we do not have any working software to show off.
