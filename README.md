## Iteration 1
For this iteration, the team worked on setup up, review, and implementing the model class for our dungeon adventure project. Issues of note include time restrictions and communication. Going forward we plan on meeting every Tuesday and Thursday to touchbase and keep on track. Currently, we do not have any working software to show off. 

## Iteration 2
For this iteration, the team worked on writing user stories and restructuring project tasks, learning to use JavaFX, and further development, implementation, and testing of classes for our project. A major issue was the need to rewrite our user stories to represent the user (or more specifically, player) perspective. Fortunately, we were able to nest many of the tasks produced last week under these new user stories. We don't yet have working software to present.

## Iteration 3
For this iteration, the team worked on designing the dungeon levels and layout, began to implement JavaFX, and completed the monster user story. A major issue was that two team members became ill with the flu, and so our progress was somewhat slower this week. We are pretty close to having working software to present.

## Iteration 4
For this iteration, the team worked setting up GUI controls, and implementing the Room, Maze, and Item classes. In terms of where we are at with the GUI, the layout for most menus should be finished by the next iteration, from there we will need to implement a fair bit of controller code. With the dungeon map generation, an alogrithm for backtracking is still needed, however the dungeon is coming along well. It is worth noting that for our pivotal tracker finished stories, we recently went through and re-did all of them, meaning we have no history of completed stories from before the change (2 iterations ago). We also had no new user stories created.

## Iteration 5
For this iteration, the team continued to learn JavaFX (including how to initialize data in Scenes), populated the Hero list for potential New Game scenes, and continued refactoring the various dungeon classes, including work on the maze algorithm (which should be fully functional by the end of this week). A major issue was that one team member became ill with covid, while another continues to recover from the flu. This, combined with the Thanksgiving holiday, meant slower progress this week.
