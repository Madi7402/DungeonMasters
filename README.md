# DungeonMasters
## By: Jonathan Abrams, Madison Pope, Martha Emerson
## Iteration 1
For this iteration, the team worked on setup up, review, and implementing the model class for our dungeon adventure project. Issues of note include time restrictions and communication. Going forward we plan on meeting every Tuesday and Thursday to touchbase and keep on track. Currently, we do not have any working software to show off. 

## Iteration 2
For this iteration, the team worked on writing user stories and restructuring project tasks, learning to use JavaFX, and further development, implementation, and testing of classes for our project. A major issue was the need to rewrite our user stories to represent the user (or more specifically, player) perspective. Fortunately, we were able to nest many of the tasks produced last week under these new user stories. We don't yet have working software to present.
